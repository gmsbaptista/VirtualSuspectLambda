# Natural Language Generator

The Natural Language module was inherited from the original prototype, but most of the code and actual logic was of my own design, as it was originally in a very limited state.
I added more components according to the changes and additions to the Virtual Suspect and defined all of the actual Natural Language Generation (but nothing too complex).
